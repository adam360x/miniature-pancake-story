There once was a great adventurous pancake.  He travelled long and far to
find his true love of butter.  He did not care the type of butter. 
This great pancake long dreamed of real milk based butter, I can't believe
it's not butter, and every other product imaginable.  However, as soon as this
little pancake would try to meet his match, the butter would not recognize him
as a pancake.  He was so small, they would see him as a piece of candy.  This 
pancake's heart was truly devistated.  Until one day, he found his perfect
match.  True love at last.  The pancake found restaurant style  butter
in the shape of miniature hershey's chocolate bars.  It was meant to be,
and the miniature pancake lived happily ever after.

Or so he thought, the miniature pancake had a lot more in store.
That day he found out he was going to be served to be eaten.
This was tragic for him, he didn't know how to react.
He just had to accept it, because he is a pancake.
