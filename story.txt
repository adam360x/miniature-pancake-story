There once was a great adventurous pancake.  He travelled long and far to
find his true love of butter.  He did not care the type of butter. 
This great pancake long dreamed of real milk based butter, I can't believe
it's not butter, and every other product imaginable.  However, as soon as this
little pancake would try to meet his match, the butter would not recognize him
as a pancake.  He was so small, they would see him as a piece of candy.  This 
pancake's heart was truly devistated.  Until one day, he found his perfect
match.  True love at last.  The pancake found restaurant style  butter
in the shape of miniature hershey's chocolate bars.  It was meant to be,
and the miniature pancake lived happily ever after.

Or so he thought, the miniature pancake had a lot more in store.
That day he found out he was going to be served to be eaten.
This was tragic for him, he didn't know how to react.
He just had to accept it, because he is a pancake.

He decided after some time waiting to be eaten tha he would not take it anymore. He joined hands, or whatever you could consider hands on a pancake, and jumped off the table. They were moving as fast as they could, but they reached the door and could not open it.

At that moment the poor miniature pancake's life flashed before his eyes.
His childhood in the Hills, his first buttery love, his mother's warm smile.
All his memories before him, he realized he was completely at peace. More than that,
he was finally free. He smiled his last smile, as he was picked up and thrown in the
compost, because who wants to eat a tiny pancake that fell on the floor.

This pancakes journey was over, however, hope is not lost.  He has had another miniture pancake
that also has chocolate chips inside of it.  This discovery infuriated tiny butter and she knew
it was not her own.  She would tell the story of the great little pancake to the baby pancake
and keep his memory alive without sharing his secret of cheating.
